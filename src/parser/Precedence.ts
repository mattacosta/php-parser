/**
 * Represents the precedence levels of a terminal symbol.
 *
 * This is used to resolve conflicts by comparing a rule's precedence to that
 * of the look-ahead token. If the token's precedence is higher, the parser
 * will consume it (shift). If the rule's precedence is higher, the parser will
 * create a node using the previously parsed tokens (reduce). If both precedence
 * levels are equal, the decision is made using the token's associativity.
