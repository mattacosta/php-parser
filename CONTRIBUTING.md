# Contributing

Contributing to this project can include anything from reporting a bug to
submitting a pull request. Here is a quick guide on how you can participate:

## Reporting an issue

First, check the [existing issues](https://github.com/mattacosta/php-parser/issues)
to see if the problem has already been reported. If not, then include a short
description of the issue, steps to reproduce it (usually by including a code
sample), the expected result, and the actual result.

## Fixing an issue

Before attempting to fix an issue, make sure that it has been verified as a bug
or accepted for an upcoming milestone. For virtually all fixes, changes, or
additions, one or more test cases must also be included.

when attempting to fix a bug or implement a new feature.

Any submitted changes must follow the existing code and/or documentation style.
Tests should pass and merge conflicts with the main development branch should
be resolved prior to submitting a pull request as well.

For large, complex issues, break it down into a planned series of changes. If
possible, those changes should also be documented and tracked in the parent
issue.

## Feature requests

Just like bug reports and other problems, feature requests start as a new
issue where they are discussed **prior to implementation**. If a feature is
particularly disruptive, it may be quite some time before it gets implemented
as well (there are also semantic versioning constraints).

> :bulb: Reality check: The best way to get a feature made is to make it
yourself! Project maintainer(s) are pretty busy too.
